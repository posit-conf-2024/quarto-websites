## What we didn't get to

### Computations

Code blocks that use braces around the language name (e.g. ```` ```{r} ````) are executable, and will be run by Quarto during render.

```{{r}}
#| label: fig-airquality
#| fig-cap: "Temperature and ozone level."
#| warning: false

library(ggplot2)

ggplot(airquality, aes(Temp, Ozone)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method = "loess")
```

## What we didn't get to

### Freeze

You can use the freeze option to denote that computational documents should never be re-rendered during a global project render, or alternatively only be re-rendered when their source file changes:

```yaml
execute:
  freeze: true  # never re-render during project render
```

```yaml
execute:
  freeze: auto  # re-render only when source changes
```

## Share what you have
